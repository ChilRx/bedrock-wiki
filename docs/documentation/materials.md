| charged_creeper                           |                                 |

| entity                                    | Material not used by common entities though is the parent materials such as `entity_emissive` `entity_emissive_alpha_one_sided` `entity_custom` etc. This material enables backface culling|
| entity_alphablend                         | Useful for translucent textures |
| entity_alphablend_nocolorentity_static    |                                 |
| entity_alphatest                          | For transparancy and disables culling meaning you can see the entity face even if it is facing away from the camera unlike some entities such as signs or chests which you can see what is outside when the camera is in the entity|
| entity_alphatest_change_color             | For entities that use transparent pixels and get colored in by the game such as leather armor|
| entity_alphatest_change_color_glint       | Same as `entity_alphatest_change_color` but with enchantment glint over it|
| entity_alphatest_glint                    | This will allow for transparency and add enchantment glint overlay|
| entity_alphatest_glint_item               | Same as `entity_alphatest_glint`|
| entity_alphatest_multicolor_tint          |                                 |
| entity_beam                               |                                 |
| entity_beam_additive                      |                                 |
| entity_change_color                       | For entities that will be colored by the game such as sheep and wolf, this material does not allow for transparency|
| entity_change_color_glint                 | Same as `entity_change_color` but with enchantment glint overlay|
| entity_custom                             | This will allow transparent and translucent textures and has backface culling|
| entity_dissolve_layer0                    |                                 |
